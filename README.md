# led

quick led!

This was an experiment when I started coding on the morning of a day when I had
a show in the evening (where I also had copious other material prepared).

I did in fact deliver a pretty snappy LED player that let me do fast, pretty
lights in time to music! - thanks to ManiacalLabs for their excellent LED
control system [BiblioPixel](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel).
